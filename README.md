# Clustering on Gas Turbine Sensor Readings for Emisson Analysis
The project deals with clustering the sensor readings inorder to find the optimum readings for operation of gas turbine to operate at low emissions and satisfactory energy yeild.
## Business Problem
-Since the regulations on the exhaust gases of industries are becoming stringent as per global warming and international forums,XYZ industry having a gas turbine wants to examine the optimum operation mode for its gas turbine according to controlled emissions of CO and NOX.

-The organization wants to control its emmisions but does not want to compromise on the energy yeild of the turbine,hence needs a optimum level where yeild is at optimum level while emmissions are low.

-The organization has provided the data of the readings measured by sensors at different points of turbine,inlet and exhaust.The organization wants the turbine to be operated at optimum level with low emissions possible.


## Approach

-In order to getting the parameters/readings of sensor at optimum emission level we are using this sensor readings and clustering them using K-Means clustering,which will give us the sensor readings at different clustered levels of emissions,so that the turbine can be fine tuned and operated with those readings obtained.
